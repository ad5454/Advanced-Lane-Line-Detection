# Advanced Lane Line Detection for Self-Driving Cars

This repository contains the implementation of an advanced lane line detection system for self-driving cars. The project utilizes computer vision techniques to identify and track lane lines on road images and videos. The system employs a combination of image processing steps and algorithmic methods to achieve accurate lane line detection and visualization.

## Features

- Detects lane lines in images and videos with high accuracy.
- Utilizes perspective transformation to obtain a bird's-eye view of the road.
- Applies color and gradient thresholding to identify lane pixels.
- Employs polynomial fitting to determine the lane curvature.
- Highlights detected lane region and curvature information on images and videos.
